Each of the following visualization techniques serves different purposes, aiding in understanding and analyzing various aspects of data across different domains and contexts.

Matrix and Box Plots (Missingno)

Matrix Plot: In the context of Missingno, it's a visualization used to show missing values in a dataset. It displays a matrix where missing values are highlighted, helping to identify patterns in data completeness.

Box Plot: This is a standard statistical plot that displays the distribution of a dataset based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. It's useful for detecting outliers and comparing distributions.

Parallel Plots (Pandas)

Parallel Coordinates Plot: This is a visualization technique used to plot multivariate data. It's particularly useful for exploring how different variables in the dataset relate to each other. Each axis represents a different variable, and lines connect points based on their values across these variables.

Network Charts (Networkx)

Network Chart: NetworkX is a Python package used to create, manipulate, and study the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It allows you to visualize and analyze relationships between entities (nodes) connected by edges.

Venn (Matplotlib)

Venn Diagram: Matplotlib can be used to create Venn diagrams that display the relationships between different sets. It's a visual representation of set intersections, showing commonalities and differences between sets.

Donut (Matplotlib)

Donut Chart: Similar to a pie chart, a donut chart displays data in a circular form. It has a hole in the center, which can be utilized to display additional information or emphasize certain aspects of the data.

Spider Chart (Matplotlib)

Spider or Radar Chart: This chart is used to display multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart with multiple axes originating from the same point. It's useful for visualizing and comparing multiple quantitative variables for a single data point.

Cluster Map (Seaborn)

Cluster Map: Seaborn's cluster map is a heatmap combined with hierarchical clustering. It visualizes a matrix dataset as a grid of colored cells, where similar rows and columns are grouped together based on their similarities.

Inset Plots (Plotly)

Inset Plot: An inset plot is a smaller plot within a larger one. In Plotly, it can be used to emphasize a particular region or data subset within the context of the overall plot.
Basic 3D Scatter Plot (Plotly)

3D Scatter Plot: Plotly allows for the creation of interactive 3D scatter plots, where data points are plotted in three dimensions (X, Y, and Z axes) to visualize relationships between three variables.
